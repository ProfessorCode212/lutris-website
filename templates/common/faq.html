        <h3 id='sell-games'>Does Lutris sell games?</h3>
      </a>
      <p>
        No, we don't sell commercial games on the platform, Lutris allows you
        to install and play games purchased on a variety of different game stores such as
        Steam, Itch.io, Humble Bundle, GOG, Battle.net, EA, Ubisoft, etc.

      <a class="title" href="#lutris-on-steam">
        <h3 id="lutris-on-steam">Why not put Lutris on Steam?</h3>
      </a>
      <p>
        Lutris expects a quite substancial set of dependencies to be present in
        order to function properly. For the UI itself, Gtk must be installed along
        with multiple Python packages. In order for the runners to function, an even
        greater set of dependencies is needed. Steam games run in a sandboxed environment
        which makes it impossible for Lutris to find all the required components.<br>
        If Valve were to add the ability to install Flatpak packages from their interface
        then Lutris would be available from Steam as a side effect.<br>
        We have plans for a Godot based full screen UI and it may become available on Steam
        but in order to work, it will need Lutris installed natively or via Flatpak.
      </p>

      <a class="title" href="#gnome">
        <h3 id="gnome">Is the Gnome desktop a dependency of Lutris?</h3>
      </a>
      <p>
        No, not at all. The confusion comes from a library we ship
        unfortunately named gnome-desktop, which is not the whole Gnome desktop
        but a collection of utilities that are frequently used within the Gnome
        desktop. This library is used by the Lutris client to support
        resolution switching on Wayland.  This library itself is small and has
        few dependencies.<br/>
        You can install and use Lutris on any desktop environment. Installing
        the client won't install other Gnome components.
      </p>

      <a class="title" href="#game-dev">
        <h3 id="game-dev">I'm a game developer, can I publish my game on Lutris?</h3>
      </a>
      <p>
        You can create a page for your game and submit an installer for it but
        as of now there aren't any special features for game developers. We do
        have some plans to add a game developer role to the website, you can
        follow its development <a href='https://github.com/lutris/website/issues/83'>on Github</a>.
      </p>
      <a class="title" href="#runtime">
        <h3 id="runtime">What is the Lutris runtime?</h3>
      </a>
      <p>
        The Lutris runtime is a collection of libraries we automatically
        provide to ensure compatibility with all games and runners over all
        Linux distributions. The runtime itself is composed of parts of the
        <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-runtime">Steam runtime</a>,
        some Ubuntu 18.04 libraries and a few extra libraries
        from various places.
      </p>
        <p>
          Of course, ensuring binary compatibility over all existing Linux
          distributions is not an easy task and sometimes issues will arise. If
          such a thing happens, try disabling the runtime in the system options of
          your game. For more details on the runtime, see the
          <a href="https://github.com/lutris/docs/blob/master/LutrisRuntime.md">wiki</a>.

      <a class="title" href="#game-crash">
        <h3 id="game-crash">Game [x] crashes, what should I do?</h3>
      </a>
      <p>
        First run Lutris from a command line to see potential errors from the game.
        If you see errors related to Linux libraries, try running the game with
        the <a href='#runtime'>runtime</a> disabled. If disabling the
        runtime fixes the issue, please, notify the developers, we don't want
        to ship a broken runtime and your input can help in fixing it.
      </p>
        <p>
          If your game still doesn't launch try collecting as much info about
          your setup (name of the game, your graphics drivers, Linux distribution,
          hardware setup, desktop environment, etc.) and explain your issue to the
          <a href="#community">community</a>.
        </p>
          <p>
            If you want to troubleshoot the issue yourself, there are some good
            resources you can look into. Start by looking up the game on
            <a href="https://pcgamingwiki.com">PCGamingWiki</a>. You might run
            into a known problem and they might have a workaround.
          </p>

               If you are trying to run a Windows game, also check out
              <a href="https://appdb.winehq.org/">WineHQ's AppDB</a> or look for
              issues other Windows users are running into, in the Steam forums for
              example.

        <a class="title" href="#git-installers">
          <h3 id="git-installers">Why aren't we using git to manage installers?</h3>
        </a>
        <p>
          While it may seem tempting at first glance to think git is a good tool to
          manage lutris install scripts, anyone who spends enough time learning about
          the internals of the project will realize git isn't a good fit.
        </p>
        <p>
          The integration of git with our current infrastructure would require an enormous
          amount of work with little to no benefits. We would only use a very small subset of
          git's features and we would still need to build tools on the website to transparently
          interact with git because we don't want the knowledge of git to be a requirement for
          our users to contribute scripts.
        </p>
        <p>
          We already have a versionning system in our current database, it is simply not exposed to
          end users. Creating an UI to make those available to all users would require way less
          work than an integration with git.<br>
          On top of that, the current system of scripts is not here to stay forever. Over time, we
          will progressively migrate to installers dynamically generated through metadata. <br>
          We already have a lot of automation to fix some aspects of user submitted scripts, which would only be
          more difficult with a git backend.
        </p>
        <p>
          We understand that some people are more confortable with git than they are with API design. But just
          because all you have is a hammer, it doesn't mean everything is a nail. The "installers in git" request
          mostly shows a refusal to follow the goals of our core team. We could use some help improving our
          installer submission process and the tools for moderation. With some minimal amount of work, way less than
          what is required to integrate with git, we could make our current system faster and more reliable.

      <h2>Runners</h2>
      <a class="title" href="#runner">
        <h3 id="runner">What is a Runner?</h3>
      </a>
      <p>
        A runner is the term we use to refer to programs that can run games,
        it can be Linux itself, Wine, DOSBox, MAME, gzdoom, â€¦
        Not all game engines become runners, for example Darkplaces, the open
        source engine for Quake, is not a runner but gzdoom is. Usually
        programs become runners if they can run a variety of games, not just
        one or two.<br>
        A requirement for runners is that we must have a redistributable build
        for Linux and some integration with the Lutris client written in Python
        or JSON.<br>
        If the upstream project for a runner doesn't provide a Linux build then
        we likely have a script to compile it from source in our
        <a href="https://github.com/lutris/buildbot/">buildbot repository</a>.

      <h2>Wine games</h2>
      <a class="title" href="#wine-systemwide">
        <h3 id="wine-systemwide">Wine is broken / I have dependency issues.</h3>
      </a>
      <p>
        While Lutris can use a wide selection of Wine builds that we provide
        ourselves, it is strongly encouraged to have Wine installed from your
        operating system's package manager. This ensures that all required Wine
        dependencies are present on the system and will produce better results
        when using Lutris builds.
      </p>
      <a class="title" href="#wine-versions">
        <h3 id="wine-versions">How do I change the Wine version used in a game?</h3>
      </a>
      <p>
        If you already have a version of Wine installed, you should see a Wine
        entry on the sidebar, you can right click on it then select "Manage
        versions". From there you can install or remove any Wine build we
        provide. The wine versions are downloaded to <code>~/.local/share/lutris/runners/wine/</code>
